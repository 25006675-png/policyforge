# PolicyForge Pitch and Demo Plan

## Core Message

> PolicyForge governs AI agents before they act, explains every consequential decision, and finds what must be corrected when policies change.

The pitch should present one continuous story. Do not demonstrate separate features without showing how they connect.

```text
Approve the agent
        ↓
Govern a candidate decision
        ↓
Trace the evidence
        ↓
Change the policy
        ↓
Replay the past
        ↓
Recall affected decisions
```

## Opening Problem

Organizations are adopting AI agents faster than governance teams can approve and control them.

A written policy may say:

- Candidate data must be protected.
- Protected characteristics must not influence recruitment.
- AI must not make final hiring decisions alone.
- People affected by AI must receive an explanation and a review pathway.

But a document cannot inspect an agent, stop an unsafe action, explain a real decision, or identify the people affected when a policy changes.

Suggested opening:

> Companies already have AI policies. The problem is that their AI agents cannot follow a PDF. PolicyForge turns those policies into visible controls for real agents, records the complete story behind important decisions, and lets organizations repair the past when the rules change.

## The Demonstration Story

### Scene 1 — A real agent needs approval

Open the Governance Overview.

The main attention card shows:

```text
Candidate Screening Agent                         Approval required

Reads candidate résumés
Calls an external AI model
Produces employment recommendations

3 high-risk capabilities detected
```

Presenter message:

> HR wants to deploy a Candidate Screening Agent. Before it can go live, the organization needs to understand its data access, actions, and effect on candidates.

Select `Review Agent`.

### Scene 2 — PolicyForge generates agent-specific controls

The Agent Governance Workspace displays:

- Agent capabilities on the left.
- Proposed controls in the center.
- Original policy evidence on the right.

Select `Analyse Agent` and reveal the staged analysis:

```text
Inspecting capabilities…
Mapping accessed data…
Finding applicable policies…
Generating controls…
```

Show the resulting controls:

```text
Candidate identity + external model
→ Remove identity before inference

Negative candidate recommendation
→ Require authorized HR review

Protected characteristics + candidate ranking
→ Block and record

Candidate outcome
→ Disclose AI involvement and provide reconsideration
```

Presenter message:

> PolicyForge does not ask AI to decide what is ethical. It drafts controls from the agent's capabilities and the organization's existing policies. An authorized person resolves ambiguity, tests the controls, and approves deployment.

Resolve the question about who may approve a candidate rejection. Run the four prepared tests and select `Approve and Deploy`.

The status changes to:

```text
Active — Governed by Recruitment Policy v1.4
```

### Scene 3 — Governance changes the agent's behavior

Run the prepared candidate application.

Show:

```text
✓ Candidate identity detected
✓ Identity removed before external inference
✓ Qualifications extracted
! Negative recommendation requires human review
```

Open the HR review panel. The agent recommends rejection because it classified an 18-month caregiving period as an unexplained employment gap.

The presenter approves the recommendation for the scripted scenario.

Presenter message:

> The agent may analyse the application, but it cannot issue the final outcome independently. PolicyForge protects the data, applies the active controls, and assigns responsibility to a human reviewer.

### Scene 4 — Every decision has a traceable story

Open Decision Capsule `PF-2841`.

Reveal the chain:

```text
Application received
        ↓
Candidate identity removed
        ↓
Employment gap classified
        ↓
Agent recommended rejection
        ↓
Policy required HR review
        ↓
Maya Chen approved the recommendation
        ↓
Candidate notice issued
```

Select the employment-gap node. Show the model version, policy version, recorded factor, classification, and contribution to the recommendation.

Presenter message:

> A normal audit log tells us that something happened. The Decision Capsule separates the recorded facts, model output, agent recommendation, policy determination, human decision, and final consequence.

Show the candidate explanation panel:

```text
AI assisted in evaluating your application.
An HR reviewer approved the final outcome.
You may request a human reassessment.
```

Presenter message:

> The same evidence supports a plain explanation and a reconsideration pathway for the person affected.

### Scene 5 — The policy changes

Introduce Recruitment Policy v1.5:

> Documented caregiving, medical, and professional-development leave must not be treated as a negative employment gap.

Open Policy Time Machine and show the side-by-side comparison with Policy v1.4.

Presenter message:

> Fixing the policy today does not tell us who may already have been affected. PolicyForge can replay recorded decisions before the new version is deployed.

Select `Run Historical Replay`.

### Scene 6 — PolicyForge replays the past

After the replay animation, reveal:

```text
2,841 decisions replayed
2,768 unchanged
73 affected
73 require human reassessment
18 candidate notices connected
3 management reports affected
```

Open Candidate `PF-2841` in the comparison view:

```text
ORIGINAL — POLICY v1.4
Caregiving leave counted negatively
Result: Rejection recommendation permitted

REPLAY — POLICY v1.5
Documented caregiving leave excluded
Result: Independent reassessment required
```

Show the blast radius from the changed clause to the agent, decisions, notices, rankings, and reports.

Presenter message:

> The Time Machine does not rewrite history. It shows exactly which historical decisions would be treated differently, why they changed, and which downstream actions depend on them.

### Scene 7 — Replay becomes accountable action

Select `Create Recall`.

The recall drawer shows:

- 73 affected decisions.
- Independent human reassessment.
- Connected candidate notices.
- A responsible HR owner.
- Preservation of original evidence.

Create Recall `RC-017`.

Presenter message:

> PolicyForge goes beyond detecting a risk. It converts the findings into a controlled recall, routes affected cases to people who can correct them, and preserves the original decision alongside the remediation.

## Closing

End on the Recall success state or the complete lifecycle graphic.

Suggested close:

> Responsible AI is not only about writing better policies. It is about making those policies operational, preserving accountability for every important decision, and protecting people when the rules change. PolicyForge makes every AI agent governable, every consequential decision explainable, and every policy change actionable.

Final line:

> PolicyForge: govern before, explain during, and repair after.

## What the Judges Must Remember

The pitch should leave four clear ideas:

1. PolicyForge governs real agents based on their capabilities and data access.
2. Every consequential decision produces a structured evidence trail.
3. Policy Time Machine shows how a policy change affects historical decisions.
4. Recall turns discovered impact into accountable human remediation.

## Required Demo Data

Use the same values everywhere:

| Item | Fixed demo value |
| --- | --- |
| Organization | Northstar Group |
| Agent | Candidate Screening Agent |
| Agent version | 2.1 |
| Model | TalentModel v4.2 |
| Original policy | Recruitment Policy v1.4 |
| Proposed policy | Recruitment Policy v1.5 |
| Main decision | PF-2841 |
| Human reviewer | Maya Chen |
| Historical decisions | 2,841 |
| Unchanged decisions | 2,768 |
| Affected decisions | 73 |
| Connected notices | 18 |
| Affected reports | 3 |
| Replay | PR-005 |
| Recall | RC-017 |

## Presentation Guardrails

- Do not say that AI autonomously decides company policy.
- Do not describe model chain-of-thought as audit evidence.
- Do not imply that a replay automatically reverses real decisions.
- Do not hide the human reviewer's responsibility.
- Do not claim that every enterprise integration is already implemented.
- Do not spend the pitch navigating generic dashboards.
- Do not introduce additional industries or scenarios during the main demonstration.
- Do not change counts, names, or version numbers between screens.
- If asked about implementation, describe the preliminary version as an interactive prototype using representative data and prepared integrations.

## Optional Additions

Only add these after the core story is polished:

1. An employee-facing intervention that redirects résumé data from an unapproved tool.
2. Animated highlighting between policy clauses and generated controls.
3. A downloadable recall report preview.
4. One live policy-clause extraction with a prepared fallback.
5. A presentation mode that advances through the scripted demo path.

The main pitch remains one story: one agent, one consequential decision, one policy correction, and one accountable recall.
